## This is Sicheng Hao. Welcome to my personal page!

I am a graduate student in Northeastern University, College of Computer and Information Science. I am a research assistant in the Olga Vitek Lab. More information about our lab, click[Olga Vitek Lab](https://olga-vitek-lab.ccis.northeastern.edu/)

My research are mostly related to statistics and machine learning. I really hope my research will make a difference in the field of bioinformatics. 

### 2018

My most recent project is to develop an R-package that fit the regulation of Bioconductor. The algorithm is for protein significance analysis in shotgun mass spectrometry-based proteomic experiments with tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling.

### 2017

[Visualization for Boston Real Estate Assessment](https://sichenghao1992.shinyapps.io/DS5110/), group project with R-shiny.
