## This is Sicheng Hao. Welcome to my personal page!

I am a graduate student in Northeastern University, College of Computer and Information Science. I am a research assistant in the Olga Vitek Lab. More information about our lab, [Olga Vitek Lab](https://olga-vitek-lab.ccis.northeastern.edu/)

My research are mostly related to data science and bioinformatics. I hope my research will make a difference for the world.  

### 2018

My most recent project is to develop an R-package that fit the regulation of Bioconductor. The algorithm is for protein significance analysis in shotgun mass spectrometry-based proteomic experiments with tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling.

[Visualization for RandomTrials analysis](https://sichenghao1992.shinyapps.io/randomTrials/), Empirical Bayes analysis for phase III randomized clinical trials, visualized by R-Shiny. This is one of my projects while I was in Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, working as a research student. PI: Dr. Changyu Shen. Here are [details](https://github.com/sichenghao1992/Shiny-EBART).

### 2016 

[Hidden Markov Tree Model](https://github.com/shimlab/HMTree). This is a R-package that I help developed when I was a research assistant in Purdue Unversity. PI: [Dr. Heejung Shim](https://heejungshim.org/)
